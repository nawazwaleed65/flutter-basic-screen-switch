This repository contains a simple Flutter application demonstrating navigation between two screens using the Navigator widget. The app includes two screens:

Screen 1: A starting screen with a button to navigate to Screen 2.
Screen 2: A secondary screen with a button to return to Screen 1.

The code showcases the use of MaterialPageRoute for screen transitions and Navigator methods (push and pop) for navigating between screens. Styling has been applied to buttons and text for clarity.
